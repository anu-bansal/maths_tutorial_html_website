<h1>Srinivasa Ramanujan</h1>
<img src="srinivasa-ramanujanjpg.jpg" height="200px" id="pop"/>

<p>Srinivasa Ramanujan is best known for his contributions in the field of mathematics, 
namely in number theory.
Srinivasa Ramanujan was born in southern India in 1887.
 After demonstrating an intuitive grasp of mathematics at a young age, 
he began to develop his own theories and in 1911 published his first paper in India. 
Two years later Ramanujan began a correspondence with British mathematician G. H. Hardy 
that resulted in a five-year-long mentorship for Ramanujan at Cambridge, where he published
 numerous papers on his work and received a B.S. for research. His early work focused on infinite 
series and integrals, which extended into the remainder of his career.
 After contracting tuberculosis, Ramanujan returned to India, where he died in 1920 at 32 years of age.
Srinivasa Ramanujan died of his illness on April 26, 1920, at the age of 32.
 And even on his deathbed had been consumed by math, 
writing down a group of theorems that he said had come to him in a dream.
 These and many of his earlier theorems are so complex that the full scope of Ramanujan's legacy
 has yet to be completely revealed and his work remains the focus of much mathematical research.
 His collected papers were published by Cambridge University Press in 1927.
Of Ramanujan's published papers — 37 in total — professor Bruce C. 
Berndt reveals that "a huge portion of his work was left behind in three notebooks and a 'lost' notebook.
 These notebooks contain approximately 4000 claims, all without proofs. 
Most of these claims have now been proved, and like his published work, continue to inspire modern-day mathematics." 
A biography of Ramanujan titled The Man Who Knew Infinity was published in 1991
 and a movie of the same name starring Dev Patel as Ramanujan and Jeremy Irons as Hardy, premiered in September 2015 at the Toronto Film Festival.</p>



<h1>Aryabhata</h1>
<img src="aryabhata-2.png" height="250px" id="pop"/>

<p>Aryabhata was an acclaimed mathematician-astronomer. 
He was born in Kusumapura (present day Patna) in Bihar, India.
 His contribution to mathematics, science and astronomy is immense,
 and yet he has not been accorded the recognition in the world history of science.
 At the age of 24, he wrote his famed "Aryabhatiya". He was aware of the concept of zero,
 as well as the use of large numbers up to 1018. He was the first to calculate the value
 for ‘pi’ accurately to the fourth decimal point. He devised the formula for calculating
 areas of triangles and circles. He calculated the circumference of the earth as 62,832 miles,
 which is an excellent approximation, and suggested that the apparent rotation of the heavens
 was due to the axial rotation of the earth on its axis. He was the first known astronomer
 to devise a continuous counting of solar days, designating each day with a number.
 He asserted that the planets shine due to the reflection of sunlight, 
and that the eclipses occur due to the shadows of moon and earth.
 His observations discount the “flat earth” concept,
 and lay the foundation for the belief that earth and other planets orbit the sun.
Aryabhata’s work was of great influence in the Indian astronomical tradition
 and influenced several neighboring cultures through translations. 
Some of his works are cited by Al-Khwarizmi, and in the 10th century by Al-Biruni.
The Aryabhata Knowledge University (AKU), Patna, has been established by the Government of Bihar
 in his honor for the development and management of educational infrastructure related to technical,
 medical, management and allied professional education.
India’s first satellite Aryabhata is named in his honor.
At the Aryabhata Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIOS) near Nainital, 
India, research in astronomy, astrophysics and atmospheric sciences is conducted.</p>


<h1>Pythagoras</h1>

<p> Pythagoras of Samos was a famous Greek mathematician and philosopher (c. 570 – c. 495 BC).
He is known best for the proof of the important Pythagorean theorem, which is about right triangles.
 He started a group of mathematicians, called the Pythagoreans, who worshiped numbers and lived like monks. 
He had an influence on Plato.
He had a great impact on mathematics, theory of music and astronomy.
 His theories are still used in mathematics today. 
He was one of the greatest thinkers of his time.
Pythagoras was born in Samos, a little island off the western coast of Asia Minor.
 There is not much information about his life. He was said to have had a good childhood.
 Growing up with two or three brothers, he was well educated. He did not agree with the government
 and their schooling, so he moved to Croton and set up his own cult (little society) of followers under his rule.
 His followers did not have any personal possessions, and they were all vegetarians.
 Pythagoras taught them all, and they had to obey strict rules.
Some say he was the first person to use the term philosophy.
 Since he worked very closely with his group, the Pythagoreans, 
it is sometimes hard to tell his works from those of his followers.</p>
